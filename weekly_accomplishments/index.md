# WEEKLY ACCOMPLISHMENTS

Week ending 9/20

Accomplishment -

I downloaded ﻿﻿VMware so that I will eventually have it ready for setting up the servers. I also downloaded an Ubuntu and CentOS ISO to set up and was successfully able to boot the operating system and record the installation instructions.
Challenge -

I set up the CentOS ISO without any issues, but the Ubuntu server keeps failing. After I fill out all of the prompts, the system resets with a fail message and loops back to the beginning. I will have to try a different version or virtual machine.

Week ending 10/4
Accomplishment -  I was unable to get the Ubuntu server to work within a virtual machine last week, and so this week I decided to download Ubuntu Server on to a Raspberry Pi instead. The setup was much simpler and I was quickly able to get the system up and running.
Challenge - Now that I have my 2 systems up and running, I can start to configure them

Week ending 10/24

Accomplishment - I have started to create my portfolio for the mid-term. I am using github pages to host my portfolio as a website (mildredsuriel.github.com). This is nice because its easily integrated with my github account. I have added some initial information using markdown files. Github also supports Jeckyll, which I may look in for a more professional template to use.
Challenge - After submitting the sed/awk/grep assignments, I must now revise them and include them into my portfolio in a nice way. I have not had a chance to look at the admin assignment yet, which was estimated to be done this week. With the midterm next week, I will be focusing on getting my portfolio prepared. I hope to get the networking and continue setup assignments submitted before the midterm deadline as well.
