# WEEKLY ACCOMPLISHMENTS

- Week ending 9/20

Accomplishment - I downloaded ﻿﻿VMware so that I will eventually have it ready for setting up the servers. I also downloaded an Ubuntu and CentOS ISO to set up and was successfully able to boot the operating system and record the installation instructions.

Challenge - I set up the CentOS ISO without any issues, but the Ubuntu server keeps failing. After I fill out all of the prompts, the system resets with a fail message and loops back to the beginning. I will have to try a different version or virtual machine.

- Week ending 9/27

Accomplishment - I have started to look at the grep/sed/awk assignments and have already completed some of the require questions. 

Challenge -  I am still struggling with installing Ubuntu in a virtual machine. Next week, I'm going to try installing Ubuntu on a raspberry pi intead. 

- Week ending 10/4

Accomplishment -  I was unable to get the Ubuntu server to work within a virtual machine last week, and so this week I decided to download Ubuntu Server on to a Raspberry Pi instead. The setup was much simpler and I was quickly able to get the system up and running.

Challenge - Now that I have my 2 systems up and running, I can move on to the next assignments. Having issues with this installation has put me behind with the linux command assignments, so I will try to finish those next week.

- Week ending 10/11

Accomplishment - I have submitted my grep/sed/awk assignments, knocking down the linux commands portion of the assignments. I have also set up my github account at github.com/mildredsuriel and started to upload files.

Challenge - Now that I have finished my linux assignments, I can focus on the continued setup assignments next week.

- Week ending 10/18

Accomplishment - I have completed the continued setup portion for my Ubuntu server. 

Challenge - I took a look at the user management assignment, and decided that the networking assignment might be easier to start with, and so for now I am going to skip the user management assignment.

- Week ending 10/24

Accomplishment - I have started to create my portfolio for the mid-term. I am using github pages to host my portfolio as a website (mildredsuriel.github.com). This is nice because its easily integrated with my github account. I have added some initial information using markdown files. Github also supports Jeckyll, which I may look in for a more professional template to use.

Challenge - After submitting the sed/awk/grep assignments, I must now revise them and include them into my portfolio in a nice way. I have not had a chance to look at the admin assignment yet, which was estimated to be done this week. With the midterm next week, I will be focusing on getting my portfolio prepared. I hope to get the networking and continue setup assignments submitted before the midterm deadline as well.

- Week ending 11/1

Accomplishment - This week, I have really polished up my portfolio for the midterm presentation, including adding links to previous projects and uploading my completed assignments so far. 

Challenge - I have done all assignments up to date for Ubuntu, and I will have to do some catch up on Centos. Hopefully, it should almost be as simple as copying commands and taking new screenshots.

- Week ending 11/8

Accomplishment - I have finished Splunk Fundamentals Part 1, allowing me to skip the Firewall assignment which was due this week. By doing that, I am currently all caught up on assignments.

Challenge - The Security Part 1 assignment also looks like it will be difficult, so I need to start looking into the details there. Luckily, there are 2 weeks until this assignment is due.

- Week ending 11/15

Accomplishment - I have completed the first portion of Security Part 2 and wrote a bash script to check for changed users, and have begun to look into how to create a cron job from the bash script.

Challenge - I am still having difficulties with Security Part 1. Instead, I think I am going to start working on Splunk Fundamentals Part 2 as a bonus assignment.

- Week ending 11/22

Accomplishment - I have completed about half of Splunk Fundamentals Part 2, and I have installed and run Lynis on both of my servers for Security Hardening.

Challenge - Since I do not have Security Part 1 done, I am technically now behind the due dates, so I will need to get the Splunk assignment completed so that I can be caught up.

- Week ending 11/29

Accomplishment - I received my grade back for the midterm at the beginning of the week, and I received a 100 which I am really happy about. I also spent holidy time with my family.

Challenge - I had a difficult time getting much work done this week due to the holidays and travelling, and so I likely won't have time to complete the containers assignment.

- Week ending 12/6 

Accomplishment - I have finished Splunk Fundamentals Part 2, allowing me to replace the Security Part 1 assignment. I have also finished the Cron job for Security Part 2.

Challenge - I still need to finish the daemon and emergency mode portions to Security Part 2, and describe how I will harden my security as a result of the Lynis results. I definitely will not have time to do the container assignment.

- Week ending 12/13

Accomplishment - I have finished the daemon and emergency mode portions to Security Part 2.

Challenge - With so little time, I don't think it is worth looking into the last container assignment. All I have left is to record my final presentation before Tuesday night, as well as the post mortem due at the end of the week.
