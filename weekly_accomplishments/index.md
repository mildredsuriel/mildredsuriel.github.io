# WEEKLY ACCOMPLISHMENTS

- Week ending 9/20

Accomplishment - I downloaded ﻿﻿VMware so that I will eventually have it ready for setting up the servers. I also downloaded an Ubuntu and CentOS ISO to set up and was successfully able to boot the operating system and record the installation instructions.

Challenge - I set up the CentOS ISO without any issues, but the Ubuntu server keeps failing. After I fill out all of the prompts, the system resets with a fail message and loops back to the beginning. I will have to try a different version or virtual machine.

- Week ending 9/27

Accomplishment - I have started to look at the grep/sed/awk assignments and have already completed some of the require questions. 

Challenge -  I am still struggling with installing Ubuntu in a virtual machine. Next week, I'm going to try installing Ubuntu on a raspberry pi intead. 

- Week ending 10/4

Accomplishment -  I was unable to get the Ubuntu server to work within a virtual machine last week, and so this week I decided to download Ubuntu Server on to a Raspberry Pi instead. The setup was much simpler and I was quickly able to get the system up and running.

Challenge - Now that I have my 2 systems up and running, I can move on to the next assignments. Having issues with this installation has put me behind with the linux command assignments, so I will try to finish those next week.

- Week ending 10/11

Accomplishment - I have submitted my grep/sed/awk assignments, knocking down the linux commands portion of the assignments. I have also set up my github account at github.com/mildredsuriel and started to upload files.

Challenge - Now that I have finished my linux assignments, I can focus on the continued setup assignments next week.

- Week ending 10/18

Accomplishment - I have completed the continued setup portion for my Ubuntu server. 

Challenge - I took a look at the user management assignment, and decided that the networking assignment might be easier to start with, and so for now I am going to skip the user management assignment.

- Week ending 10/24

Accomplishment - I have started to create my portfolio for the mid-term. I am using github pages to host my portfolio as a website (mildredsuriel.github.com). This is nice because its easily integrated with my github account. I have added some initial information using markdown files. Github also supports Jeckyll, which I may look in for a more professional template to use.

Challenge - After submitting the sed/awk/grep assignments, I must now revise them and include them into my portfolio in a nice way. I have not had a chance to look at the admin assignment yet, which was estimated to be done this week. With the midterm next week, I will be focusing on getting my portfolio prepared. I hope to get the networking and continue setup assignments submitted before the midterm deadline as well.

- Week ending 11/1

Accomplishment - This week, I have really polished up my portfolio for the midterm presentation, including adding links to previous projects and uploading my completed assignments so far. 

Challenge - I have done all assignments up to date for Ubuntu, and I will have to do some catch up on Centos. Hopefully, it should almost be as simple as copying commands and taking new screenshots.
