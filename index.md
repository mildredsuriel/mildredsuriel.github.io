# Welcome to my portfolio!

My name is Mildred Suriel, and I am an IT specialist currently working on completing my Associates in IT at Northern Essex Community College. I also work at Rockport Technology Group Inc, providing IT support to the companies we service.

This portfolio is meant to display my background in information technology and computer systems. You can find examples of built-in Linux commands such grep, awk, and sed that I have practiced using. There are also some simple bash scripts I have written for previous assignments, as well as instructions on how to configure a centOS server within VMware and how to configure an Ubuntu server on a Raspberry Pi. All of the above details can be located on my Linux page.

Aside from basic Linux scripting and OS configurations, I am also experienced in Python, where I have made an automated texting app using Twilio, and developed regex expressions for number and email verification.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mildredsuriel/mildredsuriel.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.
