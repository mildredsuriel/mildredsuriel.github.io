Now that you have settled into your new job at Acme Corp, we have decided to give you the responsibility of user management.

You have been asked to add to your system four groups of users: admin, developers, staff and temp. Each should have their own group and an associated folder that they have access to. Within each groups folder should be a read only folder for policies and such. There should also be a public read only folder for general company policy.  



You should add users for testing from the attached user lists. Any repetitive task should be scripted (shell or Python or hybrid). Admin users should be added to sudo with full permission. Each group should have a skeleton directory. The developers should default to c shell. Temps should have a limit to their disk usage.

Turn in any scripts you have written, a link to your GitHub where you have posted your scripts, and  screenshot(s) that best shows you were able to complete this task successfully. Use your own best judgment for how many you need, but remember this will be added to your documentation.

Test your scripts on both levels of UserNames attached to this lab. For adding to groups, any users can be added to any group, split it up however you like but document who's in which group. This lab is considered complete when both UserNames are added to both your servers using the scripts you've made, including the group add.



Deliverables:

A well commented script (or set of scripts) that achieves the set out tasks as outlined above including  A link to your GitHub where you've posted your scripts.

A short document explaining how you decided to set up your username rules (first letter last name, first name only, random characters and last name, etc) as well as a list of who is in which group. And any extra rules or regulations you've decided are important for each group.  You should also include any dicumentation needed for how to run your scripts.  Do they  need any special files? Any special formats expected? Any assumptions you've made as you're writing your scripts?

A short document showing you've been able to successfully add all users from both levels to both your distros.  Can be done with screenshots or a textfile taken from your servers
